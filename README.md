# Atlas

The Atlas Engine is an experimental project, which was initially built following [The Cherno's](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno) Game Engine series.

## Getting Started
At the moment, Visual Studio 2022 is recommended. Atlas is officially untested on other development environments whilst I focus on a Windows build.
Here are the following steps to get Atlas running on your computer:
1. Clone the repository to a local destination using git: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Bart-soldier/Atlas`,
2. Execute `scripts/Win-GenProjects.bat`,
3. Launch `Atlas.sln`
4. Build and execute the project.

When cloning the repository, make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!
