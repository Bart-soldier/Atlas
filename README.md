# Atlas

The Atlas Engine is an experimental project, which was initially built following [The Cherno's](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno) Game Engine series.

## Getting Started
At the moment, Visual Studio 2022 is recommended. Atlas is officially untested on other development environments whilst I focus on a Windows build.

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/Bart-soldier/Atlas`

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!
